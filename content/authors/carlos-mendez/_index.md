After studying Commercial Engineering in Bolivia and Chile, I worked as a consultant for Pro-Mujer International, The World Bank, DANIDA, and JICA. I have a M.A. and a Ph.D. in International Development from Nagoya University. My research interests focus on the integration of econometrics, spatial data science, and machine learning methods to understand and inform the process of economic growth and development of countries, regions, industries, and firms. In particular, my current research deals with (1) the quantitative geography of developoment; (2) regional economic growth and convergence; (3) regional labor markets outcomes and macroeconomic shocks; and (4) structural change and firm productivity dynamics.
